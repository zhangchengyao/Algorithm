Intended to study Algorithm Specialization on Coursera.

## DivideAndConquer <br>
*Assignment1* <br><br>
  Implement Karatsuba's integer multiplication algorithm. <br><br>
*Assignment2* <br><br>
  Implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm to compute the number of inversions of the given file. <br><br>

## RandomizedAlgorithm <br>
*Assignment3* <br><br>
  Compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given input file by QuickSort. <br><br>
*Assignment4* <br><br>
  Run the randomized contraction algorithm to compute minimum cut of a simple undirected graph. <br><br>

## Graph Search <br>
*Assignment1* <br><br>
  Computer strongly connected components of a directed graph using Kosaraju's algorithm. <br><br>
*Assignment2* <br><br>
  Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. <br><br>

## Data Structure <br>
*Assignment3* <br><br>
  Implement the Median Maintenance algorithm. <br><br>
*Assignment4* <br><br>
  Implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm with hash table. <br><br>

## Greedy Algorithm <br>
*Assignment1* <br><br>
(1)Run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in decreasing order of the difference (weight - length) and (optimally)ratio (weight/length). <br>
(2)Run Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm on an undirected graph. <br><br>
*Assignment2* <br><br>
(1)Implement the clustering algorithm for computing a max-spacing k-clustering. <br>
(2)Run the clustering algorithm, but on a MUCH bigger graph. <br><br>
